Quite a trick if anybody asks you . Rocambole is a sort of poor man's Arsene Lupin and if you've read of or seen on the screen his exploits then nothing here will come as too much of a surprise , in fact , the mixture as before would cover it .

The overall economics of the pipeline project have to be supported almost entirely by the new power plant. At most, we could assume maybe 5,000-10,000/day of gas load from industrials near the airport, and another X,000 from Kirtland's gas load. This assumed load will ramp up over several years (or longer depending on how long these folks existing contracts are) and not be available immediately. 2. We know the bogey for pricing the electric contract for DOE. Its probably $0.042/KWh, less 15-20% to make it attractive, or maybe $0.056, less 15-20%. Either way, a low rate. 3. We now know the best case scenario for cost on the pipeline--about $17 mm in the 16\\\" configuration, without the Isleta lateral or the lateral over to the power plant. Maybe about $20mm total? 4. We don't have absolutely reliable info on electric transmission constraints from the proposed plant to Palo Verde, so I'd suggest that for now we just assume\",\n          \"Here's a job board for technical support professionals... insutry associations can be a good source of job leads that you may not find on the big commercial boards. urlLink Association of Support Professionals: Jobs\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_2\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5832,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"I had met one of my targets from last year, which was to improve my maths.
