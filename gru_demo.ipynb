The film has a stagey feel from being shot on sets with characters occasionally speaking directly to the camera , avoids excesses ( excesses cost money ) , and relies mostly on a \\\" less is more \\\" philosophy to get from start to finish . Nonetheless , \\\" Hav Plenty \\\" has a sort of quietly endearing charm which must flow from Cherot as he is the auteur and lead actor and it - is - a true story . . . . or so he tells us in the film ( and I Tivo'd is from the \\\" True Stories \\\" channel on cable ) .\",\n          \"Taggart Next time you're listening into 'Radio Free Adolph' check out: Mashin' on the Motorway; 2:58; DJ Shadow; The Private Press I'm not certain how to make a link into my iTunes radio station....\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_2\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5804,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Probably not one of Abbott and Costello's shining moments .

It really varies. I have an alarm clock (her name is TinyE) and she goes off at inconsistent times. Usually it is between 6:00 and 7:00. 2. Do you sleep in on the weekends? How late? No, my alarm clock does not recognize weekends. I used to sleep in until like 8. Sometimes I get up super early (5:30) and play golf. 3. Aside from waking up, what is the first thing you do in the morning? Void. 4. How long does it take to get ready for your day? It varies, sometimes I surf the web and that extends my prep time. It usually takes me about 30 minutes.
