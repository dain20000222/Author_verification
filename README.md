## Project Overview
This project is part of the COMP34812 coursework, focusing on the Authorship Verification (AV) task. We employ GRU and BERT model to determine if two text sequences are written by the same author.

### Data Sources 
**Training and Development Data**: Provided exclusively for the COMP34812 coursework, encompassing 30K training pairs and 6K development pairs.

### Inspirational Sources
- **Research Paper**: This implementation is inspired by the findings in [Deep learning based authorship identification](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1174/reports/2760185.pdf) and [Siamese BERT for Authorship Verification](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2936/paper-193.pdf).
These paper detail the use of Siamese network structures with GRU and BERT for effective authorship verification.
